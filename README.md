## Input
This React Native application does not require any external user input. All necessary data, such as the user's name, 
degree program, and school, is hardcoded within the code. Specifically, the input values are "Honorine Ndom Ndzah", "MSCS", and "STC", each displayed using a Text component.

## Process
The app uses a functional component to render a simple user interface. A single View component is styled using a Stylesheet to set a yellow background and center the content. 
Inside this view, three Text components are used to display static values. Styling is centralized in a single Stylesheet, adhering to the requirement of using one style object.

## Output
The final output is a mobile screen with a yellow background displaying the name, degree, and school. The text is centered and formatted using React Native components, meeting both user and system requirements effectively. This can be shown in the screenshot below:
